# CS-320 Projects

## Overview
This repository contains my project work for **CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance** at Southern New Hampshire University. It includes selected artifacts from both Project One and Project Two that demonstrate my ability to design, test, and maintain high-quality software systems through the use of automated testing and quality assurance strategies.

## Project Artifacts

### Project One: Contact Service
This project involved creating and testing a contact management system. It focused on implementing and verifying core software testing concepts such as unit testing, test-driven development (TDD), and validation logic.

**Included files:**
- `Contact.java`
- `ContactService.java`
- `ContactTest.java`
- `ContactServiceTest.java`

These files demonstrate my ability to write functional code alongside test automation to ensure quality, consistency, and maintainability throughout the development process.

### Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report
This project focused on analyzing software testing methodologies, automation frameworks, and overall quality assurance processes. The report provides a summary of the testing approaches used, lessons learned, and reflections on how software testing fits within the full software development lifecycle (SDLC).

**Included file:**
- `CS320_Project_Two_Report_Justin_Turner (1) (2).docx`

## Reflection

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code is both functional and secure, I apply a combination of **automated testing**, **manual validation**, and **secure coding practices**. I write unit tests for all major components to confirm functionality and detect errors early in the development process. Using test-driven development (TDD) helps guide my design to meet requirements before implementation. For security, I validate all input data, handle exceptions appropriately, and avoid hardcoding sensitive information. Additionally, performing regular code reviews and using static analysis tools helps identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure design principles.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by carefully reviewing **requirements documents**, **user stories**, and **acceptance criteria** to identify the features that will provide the most value. I then translate those needs into system requirements and design specifications that can be implemented and tested. By maintaining communication with stakeholders and validating functionality through testing, I ensure the final product aligns with user expectations and business goals.

### How do I approach designing software?
My software design process begins with understanding the problem domain and identifying the core requirements. I use **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles to build modular, reusable, and scalable components. I also focus on designing with testing in mind—ensuring that every class and method can be verified through automated tests. Documentation and version control play a key role in my workflow, helping maintain clarity and collaboration throughout the development cycle. This structured and test-focused approach ensures my software is reliable, maintainable, and adaptable for future needs.

## Repository Purpose
This repository serves as part of my **SNHU Computer Science Portfolio**. It highlights my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance, as well as my ability to design secure and functional software. These artifacts reflect my progress and understanding of professional software development practices.
